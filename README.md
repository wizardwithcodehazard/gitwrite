GitWrite is a simple, distraction-free web app that lets you freewrite your thoughts, ideas, or code snippets â€” and save them **privately to your own GitHub repository**.

Inspired by Freewrite, 
GitWrite adds a personal twist: your words stay yours â€” no cloud snooping, no subscriptions, just your own private Git space.

## ðŸš€ What is Freewriting?

Freewriting is a simple writing technique where you just write without stopping â€” no edits, no judgment.
Think of it as a brain dump:

* Rant about how much you hate your boss.
* Pour your heart out after a heartbreak.
* Jot down random shower thoughts or raw ideas.

Itâ€™s a great way to break creative blocks and let your mind flow freely.
